## About Me

Hello my name is Mariah McMichael. Currently, I am a senior at Morgan State University. I plan to graduate in May 2024 with a bachelor of science in computer science.

## About My Mentor

Dr. Monica Anderson is a associate professor in the College of Engineering at the University of Alabama. Dr. Anderson earned her BS in Computer Science from Chicago State University (1990) and her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Minnesota (2007). In 2008, she received the 2008 UPE Excellence in Instruction Award. She is an executive member of the iAAMCS alliance, a national consortium of researchers that focus on increasing the number of African Americans in Computer Science with advanced degrees. Research projects studied autonomous robot teams, Computer Science education, and broadening participation. The results of these projects included identification of mitigating factors an operatorâ€™s trust of autonomous systems, mechanisms for increasing self-efficacy in computer science introductory courses using robotics, and approaches on improving the design of autonomous device frameworks.  Current education-related research concerns the efficient teaching of memory-reliant programming concepts.

## About My Project

The goal is to create a mechanism to disseminate information of local resources for caregivers of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. To accomplish this goal, a chatbot will be implemented. It will require a backend database of resources that are sourced in a variety of ways that must be maintained. The resources are location specific so the backend database will require geographic information system (GIS) services.
