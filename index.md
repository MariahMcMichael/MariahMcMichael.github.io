## About Me

Hello my name is Mariah McMichael and I am a senior computer science major at Morgan State University. I plan to graduate December 2023. Feel free to email at mariah.mcmichael@outlook.com. 

## About My Mentor

Dr. Monica Anderson is a associate professor in the College of Engineering at the University of Alabama. Dr. Anderson earned her BS in Computer Science from Chicago State University (1990) and her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Minnesota (2007). In 2008, she received the 2008 UPE Excellence in Instruction Award. She is an executive member of the iAAMCS alliance, a national consortium of researchers that focus on increasing the number of African Americans in Computer Science with advanced degrees. Research projects studied autonomous robot teams, Computer Science education, and broadening participation. The results of these projects included identification of mitigating factors an operatorâ€™s trust of autonomous systems, mechanisms for increasing self-efficacy in computer science introductory courses using robotics, and approaches on improving the design of autonomous device frameworks.  Current education-related research concerns the efficient teaching of memory-reliant programming concepts.

## About My Project

![uaprojectsummary](/images/uaprojectsummary.png)

Project summary: The goal is to create a mechanism that disseminates information on local resources for caregivers of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. A chatbot may be easier for seniors and caregivers to use.  A backend database of resources that are sourced in a variety of ways must be maintained. There is a challenge of keeping the data up to date. Resources are geographic so the backend database must use GIS services.
