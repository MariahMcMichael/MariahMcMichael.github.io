### Making Progress

----

This week, while testing the new targeted conversations I discovered the conversations were becoming less influenced by the user’s input. After researching ways to fix this we considered creating slots to store specific information within the conversations. During this time, I began to research user interface designs starting with a site I used frequently. 

University of Alabama has shuttles that can take students, falcuty, and vistors on and off campus called Crimson Ride. Almost each day I have been the university I have rode on the shuttle. Before I walk to the bus hub to board the shuttles I typically check what time the shuttle arrives using the app or website Passio Go because it provides users the ability to view all of the Crimson Ride buses in "real time". One of the features I liked was the way you could hover or click on a bus to recieve additional information for that specific bus. Dr. Anderson and I discussed adding this as feature to a map of Alabama to help the user experience when trying to locate local resources.
