This week I focused on building routines. I created a workout, sleep, and work routine so that I become displine while I am here in Alabama. Part of my routine includes waking up early and catching the campus shuttle to go work out at the student receration center. Each day I am challenging myself to jog on the treadmill longer than I did the day before. I have also started to eat a healthier diet. I tried some delious overnight oats at a resturant in the student receration center this week. 

My work routine starts with me taking a short walk from my dorm room to get to the lab. Once I'm in the lab I log into my computer and check Microsoft Teams to see if Dr. Anderson, my labmate, or the graduate student working with the DREU project has any updates to report. Then, I proceed to start on any tasks I need to complete.

With Dr. Anderson's assistance I was able to set up the programming environment then we were able to plan the goals of the project for next two weeks. The goal is to implement five new conversations for the chatbot. I will be utilzing a flowchart to map out the convosations then test them .
