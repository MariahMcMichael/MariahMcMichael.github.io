### Still Planning, Coding, Building, and Testing

----

This week, I worked on developing the training data. I researched and sourced various Alabama Area Agency on Aging Senior Resource Directories to get lastest local resources data. After reviewing our chatbot conversation flowchart, I mentioned to Dr. Anderson that allowing the user to input their zip code or city then storing the location could be helpful in the chatbot. She agreed and I proceeded to start implementing those additions as well as  conditional response variations.
