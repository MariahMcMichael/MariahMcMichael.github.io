### Plan, Code, Build, and Test

----

The objective of this week was to map out the chatbot conversations. I familiarized myself with the open-source machine learning framework called Rasa to automate targeted text and voice conversations. We are using Rasa for our chatbot so I also researched several literatures about to effectively design conversations using Rasa. Then, I proceeded to execute a wide range of demo conversations. Using a flowchart, I mapped out five targeted conversations.

In celebration of Juneteenth, I attended a virtual cooking demonstration held by the Intercultural Diversity Center at the University of Alabama. The event featured a chef named Kimberly McNair Brock who is also a certified holistic health coach in Birmingham, Alabama. I was lucky enough to be one of the first 30 registrations to receive an ingredients bag. During the virtual cooking demonstration, we cooked some delicious crab fried rice, discussed the history of Juneteenth, the importance of cooking in the African American community and how cooking builds traditions.

> #### Quote of the week:
> “I increasingly believe, and remind myself, that my ideas are valuable. People will listen to and appreciate them more based on my confidence conceptualizing and sharing them. Only one idea can be chosen, but everyone has to feel confident to share theirs because it contributes to the final outcome.”
