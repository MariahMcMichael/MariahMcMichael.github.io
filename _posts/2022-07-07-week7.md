title: Week 7 -Improving the User's Experience
---

### Button, Button, Buttons

----

This week I am continuing to expand the chatbot conversation flowchart. For each button, I am implementing a targeted conversation story. We have decided to focus less on adding cities and zip codes as an option for users to select their location. Dr. Anderson and I will put our efforts into the targeted conversations and the interactive Alabama map. As I test each converstation, I find with each button I implement comes more errors to debug. My goal is to continue to build and test the chatbot using Rasa then run it from localhost.

### Week 7 Tasks:

- Test conversations

- Debug any errors

- Complete any remaining project tasks from last week
