title: Week 7 -Improving the User's Experience
---

### Button, Button, Buttons

----

This week I am continuing to expand the chatbot conversation flowchart. For each button, I am implementing a targeted conversation story. After meeting with Dr. Anderson, we decided to focus less on adding cities and zip codes as an option for users to select their location and more on creating targeted conversations. Also, we want to integrate the interactive Alabama map with the chatbot. As I test each targeted converstation, I find with each button I implement comes more errors to debug. My goal is to continue to build, test, and debug then run the chatbot from localhost.
