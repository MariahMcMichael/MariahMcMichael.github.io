This week I focused on building routines. I created a workout, sleep, and work routine. Part of my routine includes waking up early and catching the campus shuttle to go workout at the student recreation center. Each day I am challenging myself to jog on the treadmill longer than I did the day before. I also started to eat a healthier diet this week. Friday, I tried some delicious overnight oats at a resturant in the student recreation center. 

My work routine starts with me taking a short walk from my dorm room to get to the lab. Once I'm in the lab I log into my computer and check Microsoft Teams to see if Dr. Anderson, my fellow DREU participant, or the graduate student working with the DREU project has any updates to report. Then, I proceed to start on any tasks I need to complete.

With Dr. Anderson's assistance I was able to set up the programming environment then we were able to plan the goals of the project for next two weeks. The goal is to implement five new conversations for the chatbot. I will be utilizing a flowchart to map out the conversations then test them in the programming environment.
