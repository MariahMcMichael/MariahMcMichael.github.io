> #### Quote of the week:
> “We are showing people that engineering isn’t just the physics of how a transistor works. It’s using the technology, and being creative with it, and solving problems that people have, or creating something beautiful with it. And I think that’s opening up engineering to a whole new group of people that maybe never would have thought that engineering was for them.”
