### From Hello to Roll Tide!

----

This week, I met a graduate student and a fellow DREU participant working with Dr. Anderson this summer at the University of Alabama. Dr. Anderson met with us to explain the current progress of the project and the project expectations. Later, I met with Dr. Anderson to discuss how to set up my development environment. Also, I started the administrative and training tasks necessary for the project and required for the University of Alabama. During my free time, I enjoyed exploring the university and I quickly found my favorite restaurant to get a cold drink.
